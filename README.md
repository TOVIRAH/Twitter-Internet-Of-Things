# Twitter-Internet-Of-Things

This project is a super simple barebones way to get your tweets to activate some functionality on a device. The device uses this code to listen to your twitter account. When you tweet it starts. It would be trivial to modify this code to listen to the text property as well and start on a *start* command or end on an *end* command. 

# Installation 

``` 
pip install tweepy
```

# Getting it to work

```
python app.py
```
